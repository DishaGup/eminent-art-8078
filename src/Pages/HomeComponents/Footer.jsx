                <div>ShopClues brings the experience of India’s Flea Markets online, in the form of its weekly properties - Sunday Flea Market, Refreshing Monday Sale, Triple Value Friday Sale, and Wednesday Brand Bazaar. Another property capturing the essence of regional Indian shopping is called NRH (National Regional Heritage), which gives a sneak-peek into India’s Cultural Gullies at very reasonable prices. These online markets showcase products with range so wide, and prices so low, that they beat the offline neighbourhood markets of India. The concept especially works incredibly well with the middle class population habituated in tier 2 & 3 cities.</div>
